DESIGN:
1. Implemented the Reader, Expr and ExprParser classes, which are the foundation stones of this project. 
    used 'vector' to represent the expression as a tree. 
2. Implemented the Bounds class that holds the values of the bounds of the functions, 
    and the Color class that holds the value of RGB of a pixel.
3. Implemented the Image class that holds the values of the image's height and width, 
    and an array of Color objects which has RGBs of all pixels in this image.
4. Implemented the Function class that holds the name of the function, its expression, and its associated RGB value.
5. Implemented the Fill class that holds two function names (the second one for FillBetween directive), 
    the opacity and the color that is associated with the Fill directive, and an integer value indicating the type of 
    the Fill (1 = FillAbove, 2 = FillBelow, 3 = FillBetween).
6. Implemented the Plot class that holds fields that represent plot bounds, image, functions and fills. 
    Basically, the Plot directive includes the information of all other directives.
7. Implemented the Render class that holds the plot and the image. The 'render' function in Render renders the Fill 
    and the Functions.
8. Implemented main.cpp so that it catches all the errors thrown in other classes.
